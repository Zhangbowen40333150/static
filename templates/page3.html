They are usually hidden in the wrist and can be broken by the muscles to make the claws break through the skin (and the wound can be healed by the healing force) The tip of the claw is sharp and can tear any object.

                <h3>Iceman</h3>

                    Bobby was born on Washington Harbor in Long Island, New York. The father is an Irish Catholic and the mother is a Jew.
                    Bobby's ability first appeared when he was dating his girlfriend Judy Harmon at a young age, and was bullied by bully Lodge Bisley. At this time, Bobby accidentally discovered that he had the super power to freeze the moisture in the air into ice. And the Bisley was frozen.
                    After the news spread, the public regarded Bobby as a threat, and some mobs broke into Bobbyâ€™s home to look for him. Later the police came and took him to the police station to protect Bobby.
                    After Professor X heard it, he sent a laser eye to meet Bobby. After Bobby refused to shoot the laser, the two sides fought. Fortunately, Professor X finally arrived in time to stop them. Soon after, Bobby accepted the invitation of Professor X and agreed to send Bobby to X College for enrollment and became known as "Iceman." </p>

                <h3>Red tank</h3>
                <p>
                	The red tank (Juggernaut) is a behemoth that commands people's fear. It is generally used to respect the huge objects. It is also known as the destruction of the impact. I believe everyone should be familiar with this role. He is a classic villain of Marvel. It is also very common. Appeared in the X-Men series, Juggernaut was turned into "Ming Ding Ge" before Taiwan, but after the film was released, it was collectively referred to as "Red Tank." The Red Tank was squeezed into the 189th place in the famous Wizarding Manga magazine to vote for 200 popular cartoon characters in the United States. In 2009, it was ranked 19th by the IGN as the greatest comic villain. The X battle was released in 2006. Police film 3 debut, but unfortunately, he only turned him into a steel helmet and a goose in the movie. It is a pity that the movie can't show the shape of the giant man in the comic. The power of the red tank comes from the evil spirits, and it is inexhaustible. </p>

                	Some resonator guitars possess metal bodies and these are called steel guitars. This can lead to some confusion with the Hawaiian guitar of the same name. They are two distinct instruments. The Hawaiian steel guitar takes its name from the steel bar used to create the glissandi and the Resonator steel guitar refers to the material used for the construction of the body.
